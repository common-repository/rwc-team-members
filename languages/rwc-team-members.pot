"\t\t\t\t\t<blockquote>\n"
"\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In the <strong>General Settings</strong> for each team, "
"you'll find a crucial feature: <strong>Shortcode Post/Page URLs</strong>. "
"It's vital to add the page URL of the team's display location. This ensures "
"your team displays correctly based on its settings. This step keeps your "
"Custom CSS file tailored to the team, leading to faster loading and a more "
"streamlined look. This setting is pivotal - without it, your customization "
"won't take effect. Make sure to implement this feature to achieve the "
"desired team display and style.</p>\n"
